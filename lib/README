s-bsdipa, a mutation of bsdiff
==============================

Colin Percival's bsdiff, imported from FreeBSD and mutated.
In general:

- one includes s-bsdipa-lib.h and uses the all-in-memory s_bsdipa_diff()
  and s_bsdipa_patch() functions to create and apply patches.
  Ie, memory in (usually mmap(2)ed), memory out (heap).

- the actually necessary compression / storage preparation can be
  achieved easily by including s-bsdipa-io.h after defining s_BSDIPA_IO
  as desired, and using s_bsdipa_io_write() and _read().  These still do
  not perform direct I/O, but call a supplied hook with fully prepared
  buffers and store in memory, respectively.

  Note that the linker flags for the chosen compression method / library
  must be provided by whoever uses the s-bsdipa-io.h layer.

- the program s-bsdipa present in an equally named directory of the
  source repository can be inspected for a complete example picture.
  It also times execution and tracks memory usage, for your interest.

- in general the lib/ directory of the source repository is self-
  contained, and may be copied for inclusion in other projects.

- Please see the introductional header comments of s-bsdipa-lib.h and
  s-bsdipa-io.h for more.
